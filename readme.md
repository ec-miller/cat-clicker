# Cat Clicker
### Udacity Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree program

This app is part of Section 4 of the Udacity Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree program. This project is an exercise in implementing an app with changing requirements. The initial iteration of Cat Clicker simply required a single cat image to click. The second iteration required not one, but **TWO** cats for clicking. The final requirements dictated that **five cats** must be available for clicking delight + a menu for choosing which cat to click. Now is your opportunity to experience a top of the line, flexible cat-clicking experience.
